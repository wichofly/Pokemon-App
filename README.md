# Project description #
I built a small Web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. for this web application, I am using an API to get the Pokemon information to show to the users. 

# How to get the project running? 
When you enter the page, you will find the names of the 151 pokemon (the pokemons that started the cartoon). When you click on a name, a modal will appear showing the pokemon's image, height, weight, type, and skills. This information is obtained by the API
